## Rebuild locally

1. **Install Gatsby CLI**

Use the following command to install gatsby-cli. This requires you to have Node.js pre-installed on your device.
```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. **Create your project**

Navigate to your project folder and start the development server:

```bash
gatsby create {your-project-name} https://github.com/ShaneMaglangit/shanemaglangit-gatsby
cd {your-project-name}
gatsby develop
```

Now you'll be all set to go. You may access the site through http://localhost:8080/.
