## Rebuild locally

1. **Install Gatsby CLI**

Use the following command to install gatsby-cli. This requires you to have Node.js pre-installed on your device.
```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. **Start the Project**

Once you have a working clone of the project, you may use the following command to start the project.

```bash
cd {your-project-path}
gatsby develop
```

Now you'll be all set to go. You may access the site through http://localhost:8080/.
